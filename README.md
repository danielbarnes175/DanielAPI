# DanielAPI

Name is temporary. For now this is a basic API template before I figure out what I actually want this API to do. I'll probably add a bunch of functionality that I want for various projects, sort of as a library of sorts.

### Usage

The only way to use this right not is to `git clone` it yourself. There is no server currently hosting this, sorry!
